###  Allows Users to borrow books from the Library
The main rules are:
- No more than 3 books can be borrowed by one User at a time.
- Each book cannot be borrowed for more than 14 days.
- If the User does not return the book on time, this counts as violation.<br>
 Users with 2 and more violations can no longer borrow books.
